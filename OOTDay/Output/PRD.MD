# Project Overview
- OOTDay is an AI-powered fashion assistant that turns "What should I wear today?" into a personalized, shoppable journey connecting inspiration to Central Group retail inventory online and in-store.
- Value propositions: reduce outfit decision fatigue, build styling confidence, shorten the gap between inspiration and purchase, and boost partner engagement via interactive experiences that drive foot traffic.
- Target audiences:
  - Fashion-curious & social users (15-28) seeking playful, visual outfit creation tools.
  - Fashion-struggling shoppers (18-35) needing guided styling support for daily life and special occasions.
  - Mobile-first inspiration seekers (20-35) looking for occasion-specific references linked to purchasable items.
  - Professionals & special-occasion shoppers (25-45) requiring polished, context-aware recommendations.
- Market validation comes from demand for personalized fashion, growth of visual discovery/try-on apps, and retailer adoption of experiential tech like smart mirrors.
- Product vision: deliver a fun, personalized discovery and shopping loop that instantly recommends, visualizes, and sells outfits while integrating seamlessly with Central Group systems.

# Instruction
- Launch the MVP with three core capabilities: chat/search for outfits using natural language, AI matching to Central Group inventory with direct purchase links, and end-to-end integration with Central Group SKU and sales systems.
- Prioritize future roadmap items (visual search, AR try-on, smart recommendations, smart mirror experiences, extended categories) once MVP performance and integrations are stable.
- Build on the defined technical stack: Vercel + Azure infrastructure; AI/ML via Claude, Cursor, n8n, Langflow, Kling AI; design/frontend through Lovable, V0, and Figma.
- Ensure the platform supports text, link, and natural-language queries, maintains scalable Azure hosting, and delivers mobile-first responsive experiences.
- Operate on a B2B2C model (free to end users with Central Group-funded revenue) while adhering to the stated MVP budget (฿147,846) and forecasting annual operating costs (฿230,933).

# Workflow
1. Research & Planning (Months 1-4, May-Aug 2025): finalize feature scope, conduct market/user research, design architecture.
2. Prototype Development (Month 5, Sep 2025): produce MVP prototype and present business case.
3. MVP Implementation (Months 6-9, Sep-Dec 2025): complete core build, run testing cycles, refine UX.
4. Testing & Refinement (Months 10-11, Jan-Feb 2026): execute validation with users, optimize performance.
5. Launch Preparation (Month 12, Mar 2026): finalize onboarding, marketing, and launch execution.
- Parallel next steps: within 30 days confirm architecture, start MVP planning, and define integration protocols; within 90 days finish the MVP prototype, run user testing, and secure first retail partner; within 6-12 months launch the MVP, onboard 2-3 Central Group business units, and reach 1,000+ active users.

# Output
- Deliver an MVP that seamlessly connects AI styling chat/search to Central Group inventory with purchase paths ready for online and in-store experiences.
- Track success metrics: monthly active users, outfit request/search volume, virtual try-on usage, retention, conversion from inspiration to purchase, average order value lift, in-store traffic generation, and partner satisfaction.
- Target a projected annual margin contribution of ฿2.17M by leveraging 19% fashion-category chat traffic and improving conversion toward the 10% OOTDay goal.
- Mitigate key risks through continuous AI tuning, scalable cloud infrastructure, phased system integrations, ROI-focused partner pilots, and adaptable styling models that respond to trend shifts.
