**Version:** v5.1 (Final Corrected)
**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Stakeholder Approval
**Frontend-Dev Rating:** 7.5/10 - Conditional Approval ✅

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**What We're Proposing:**
Evolve OOTDay's layout from 2 panels to 3 panels to improve outfit discovery UX while **maintaining our core identity as an AI outfit assistant** (NOT a product shopping platform).

**Three-Panel Structure:**
```

**What Was Fixed:**
- Middle panel now shows **outfit recommendations** with "ดูชุด" buttons
- Users discover complete styled looks (styling mindset)
- Maintains Story 1.3's intent (dedicated outfit viewing)
- Preserves OOTDay's identity as outfit assistant

### Technical Corrections: v4.0 → v5.1

**v4.0 Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Field name corrections (`imageUrl`, `name`, `price`, `items`)
2. ✅ FilterState interface defined
3. ✅ Thai font implementation specified
4. ✅ Style classification strategy documented

**v5.0 → v5.1 Corrections:**
1. ✅ Timeline extended from 3 weeks to **4 weeks** (realistic)

## 🎯 What We're Building

### Panel Breakdown

#### Left Panel (20%): Navigation & Filters
**Purpose:** Provide filtering controls for outfit discovery

**Features:**
- Category filters (ทั้งหมด/ผู้หญิง/ผู้ชาย)
- Occasion checkboxes (งานออฟฟิศ/เดท/ชิลๆ/งานเลี้ยง)
- Price range slider for outfit total
- Quick preset buttons ("ชุดไปทำงาน", "ชุดไปงานเลี้ยง")
- Sticky position during scroll

#### Middle Panel (50%): Outfit Discovery (Home Page)
**Purpose:** Display AI-curated outfit recommendations

**🚨 CRITICAL - This is NOT Product Browsing:**
- Shows **complete outfits** (NOT individual products)
- Each card is a **styled look** for an occasion
- Search finds **outfits** ("หาชุดไปทำงาน"), not products
- Primary CTA: **"ดูชุด"** (View Outfit) → Details in right panel

**Features:**
- Outfit search: "หาชุดไปทำงาน, งานเลี้ยง, เดท..."
- Filter pills for quick occasion selection
- Grid display: 2-3 columns of outfit cards
- Each card shows: preview image, title, occasion, item count, total price
- Loading skeleton states
- Empty state with AI chat prompt

#### Right Panel (30%): Chat + Outfit Details (Dual-Purpose)
**Purpose:** AI conversation OR selected outfit breakdown

**State 1: Chat Assistant (Default)**
- OOTDay AI avatar and conversation
- Message history with outfit recommendations embedded
- Quick prompts: "ไปทำงาน", "เดทสุดสัปดาห์", "งานเลี้ยง"
- Chat input: "ถามเรื่องชุดได้เลย..."

**State 2: Selected Outfit Details**
- Outfit preview image
- Product breakdown (each item with image, name, price)
- "ซื้อเลย" (Buy Now) buttons → Gender-specific Central.co.th URLs
- Total outfit price
- "Back to Outfits" button
- Alternative outfit suggestions

│   (50%)                  │   (50%)                 │
└──────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```
**Intent:** Give outfits dedicated viewing space

### Proposed Evolution (Story 2.1 v5.1)
```
┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Navigation  │   Outfit Discovery       │  Chat + Details │
│ & Filters   │   (50%)                  │   (30%)         │

## 📊 Technical Requirements

### Type Definitions (v5.1 Corrected)

```typescript
// lib/types.ts - To be added
export interface FilterState {
  gender?: 'all' | 'men' | 'women'
  occasion?: string[]  // ['work', 'casual', 'date', 'formal']
  priceRange?: { min: number; max: number }
  searchQuery?: string
}

// Outfit interface (already exists)
export interface Outfit {
  id: string
  title: string
  occasion: string
  previewImage: string
  items: Product[]  // ✅ CORRECT (NOT products)
  style: string
}

// Product interface (already exists)
export interface Product {
  id: string
  name: string        // ✅ CORRECT (NOT product_name)
  imageUrl: string    // ✅ CORRECT (NOT product_image)
  price: number       // ✅ CORRECT (NOT product_price)
  category: string
}
```

### Font Implementation (NOT Yet Done - v5.1 Correction)

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx - TO BE ADDED
import { Noto_Sans_Thai } from 'next/font/google'

const notoSansThai = Noto_Sans_Thai({
  subsets: ['thai', 'latin'],
  weight: ['400', '500', '600', '700'],
  variable: '--font-noto-thai'
})
```

**⚠️ Status:** NOT yet implemented, needs to be added (v5.0 incorrectly claimed it was done)

### Mobile Responsive Strategy (v5.1 Clarified)

**Desktop (≥1024px):** Three panels side-by-side
```
[Navigation 20%] [Outfits 50%] [Chat/Details 30%]
```

**Tablet (768-1023px):** Filter drawer + two panels
```
[Drawer: Filters] [Outfits 60%] [Chat/Details 40%]
```

**Mobile (<768px):** Single full-screen view with bottom tabs
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│  Active Panel       │
│  (Filters/Outfits/  │
│   Chat)             │
│                     │

## ⚠️ Critical Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Architecture Approval (Required)
**Question:** Approve three-panel layout evolution from Story 1.3's two-panel layout?

**Options:**
- ✅ **Approve:** Proceed with three-panel Outfit Discovery architecture
- ❌ **Reject:** Keep current two-panel layout (Story 1.3)

**Recommendation:** ✅ Approve - Better UX while maintaining concept

---

### Decision 2: Style Classification Strategy (Required)
**Problem:** CSV product catalog lacks "style" metadata (Work/Casual/Formal/Date) needed for filtering.

**Option A: Enhance CSV with Style Column** (Recommended)
```csv
Product_Name,Category,Price,Style
White Shirt,Women,1590,"work,casual"
Floral Dress,Women,2990,"date,casual"
Black Blazer,Women,3490,"work,formal"
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Accurate, human-curated, no ML complexity
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Requires manual tagging (2,636 products)

**Option B: Implement ML/Rule-Based Classifier**
```typescript
function classifyStyle(product: Product): string[] {
  if (product.name.includes('blazer')) return ['work', 'formal']
  if (product.name.includes('dress')) return ['date', 'formal']
  // ... more rules
}
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Automated, no CSV changes
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Less accurate, requires maintenance

**Recommendation:** Option A (CSV enhancement) for accuracy

---

### Decision 3: Virtualization Library (Technical) - NEW in v5.1
**Problem:** Need to render 2,636 products without performance lag

**Options:**
- **Option A:** `react-window` - Lightweight, widely used (Recommended)
- **Option B:** `react-virtualized` - Feature-rich, larger bundle
- **Option C:** Native CSS + Pagination - No library, manual implementation

**Recommendation:** Option A (react-window) - Best balance

**⚠️ Important:** Library needs to be added to `package.json` before development

---

### Decision 4: Story 1.5 Dependency (NEW in v5.1)
**Status:** Story 1.5 (Outfit Generation) is "Ready for Review" but NOT marked "Done"

**Risk:**
- QA may find issues during Story 2.1 implementation
- Outfit generation bugs could block Phase 6 integration
- 2-3 day buffer added to timeline for potential fixes

**Decision Required:**
- [ ] Confirm Story 1.5 QA will be completed before Story 2.1 Phase 6 (Day 16)
- [ ] Acknowledge Story 1.5 as prerequisite dependency

---

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

**Revised Estimate: 4 weeks (20 days) with 1 developer** ⏱️

| Phase | Days | Deliverables |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Phase 1:** Foundation | 1-4 | Layout structure, **Thai font implementation**, FilterState type, **virtualization library setup** |
| **Phase 2:** Left Panel | 5-6 | Navigation filters, categories, occasions |
| **Phase 3:** Middle Panel | 7-10 | Outfit grid, search, filter pills, **skeleton loaders**, **empty states** |
| **Phase 4:** Right Panel | 11-13 | Chat + Outfit details dual-purpose, **accessibility** |
| **Phase 5:** Interactivity | 14-15 | State management, filtering logic, **URL persistence** |
| **Phase 6:** Data Integration | 16-17 | Story 1.5 outfit generation + **buffer for QA fixes** |
| **Phase 7:** Testing & Polish | 18-20 | **Accessibility audit**, performance testing, QA, **error handling** |

**Target Launch:** November 2, 2025 (4 weeks from approval) 📅

**Timeline Changes from v5.0:**
- ✅ Added 5 days for: Thai font implementation, virtualization setup, Story 1.5 QA buffer, comprehensive testing
- ✅ More realistic for single developer
- ✅ Includes time for missing features (accessibility, empty states, error handling)

---

## ✅ Quality Requirements (Added in v5.1)

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation: Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys
- ✅ Focus visible indicators (2px outline)
- ✅ Screen reader announcements for filter changes
- ✅ Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for text
- ✅ Touch targets ≥44x44px on mobile

### Empty & Loading States
**Empty States:**
- No outfits match filters: "ไม่พบชุดที่ตรงกับเงื่อนไข ลองปรับตัวกรอง"
- No search results: "ไม่พบชุด ลองค้นหาด้วยคำอื่น"
- Outfit generation failed: "ไม่สามารถสร้างชุดได้ในขณะนี้ กรุณาลองใหม่"

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton screens for outfit cards during filtering
- Shimmer effect on loading skeletons
- Loading spinner for outfit generation
- Debounced search (300ms) to reduce excessive requests

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if outfit generation fails
- Fallback to cached outfits if API unavailable
- Error boundary to catch React errors
- Retry mechanism for failed requests
- User-friendly error messages in Thai

### Filter Persistence
- Save filter state to URL query params (`?gender=women&occasion=work`)
- Benefits: Shareable URLs, browser back/forward, bookmarks
- Implementation: Next.js `useSearchParams` + `useRouter`

## 🔑 Why This Maintains OOTDay's Concept

### OOTDay Identity: AI Outfit Assistant ✅

**Middle Panel Shows:**
- ✅ **Complete Outfits** (NOT individual products)
- ✅ **Styled Looks** for occasions (งานออฟฟิศ, เดท, งานเลี้ยง)
- ✅ **AI-Curated Combinations** from our 2,636-product catalog

**User Mental Model:**
- ✅ "I need an outfit for X occasion" (Styling mindset)
- ❌ NOT "I want to browse products" (Shopping mindset)

**Primary Actions:**
- ✅ "ดูชุด" (View Outfit) → See complete look details
- ❌ NOT "Shop Now" → Direct to external product pages

### Comparison: What We're NOT Doing

| ❌ Product Shopping Platform | ✅ OOTDay Outfit Assistant |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Browse individual products | Browse complete outfits |
| Search by product name/brand | Search by occasion/style |
| "Shop Now" → External site | "ดูชุด" → Outfit details |
| E-commerce catalog | Styling recommendations |
| Add to cart flow | View outfit → Buy items |

## ❓ Common Questions Answered

### Q1: "Will this change our outfit assistant concept?"
**A:** No. Middle panel shows **complete outfits** (not products). We're enhancing layout while preserving the "What should I wear today?" focus.

### Q2: "Why not just add filters to current layout?"
**A:** Three panels provide better information hierarchy:
- Left: Persistent filters (always visible)
- Middle: Primary content (outfits - 50% width)
- Right: Context-sensitive (chat OR details)

Two-panel layout doesn't allow dedicated filter space.

### Q3: "Does this break Story 1.3?"
**A:** No. Story 1.3's intent was "dedicated outfit viewing" - this is preserved. We're moving outfits from right (50%) to middle (50%) for better UX. Same dedication, better position.

### Q4: "How long until users see this?"
**A:** 4 weeks after approval (November 2, 2025). We can phase rollout with feature flag if needed.

### Q5: "Why does the timeline need 4 weeks instead of 3?"
**A:** Frontend-dev agent identified:
- Thai font not yet implemented (needs implementation time)
- Virtualization library not in dependencies (needs setup)
- Story 1.5 QA buffer needed (not yet marked "Done")
- Accessibility, empty states, error handling require proper time
- 4 weeks is more realistic for quality delivery

### Q6: "What happens if Story 1.5 has issues during our Phase 6?"
**A:** We've added 2-day buffer (Days 16-17) for potential Story 1.5 fixes. If issues are severe, we can:
- Use fallback mock outfits temporarily
- Delay Phase 6 while Story 1.5 team fixes
- Continue with other testing in parallel
