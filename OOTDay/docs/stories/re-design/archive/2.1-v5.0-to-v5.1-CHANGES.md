**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Frontend-Dev Agent corrections applied

---

## üîÑ Summary of Changes

**v5.0 Status:** Initial presentation - had 6 technical inaccuracies
**v5.1 Status:** Corrected presentation - ready for stakeholder approval

**Frontend-Dev Rating:** 7.5/10 ‚Üí **Conditional Approval** ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ Critical Corrections Applied

### 1. Thai Font Status (Line 166)
**v5.0 (WRONG):**
```markdown
3. ‚úÖ Thai font implementation (Noto Sans Thai)
```

**v5.1 (CORRECTED):**
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Implementation:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Thai font (Noto Sans Thai) - NOT yet implemented, needs to be added
```

**Why:** Presentation claimed Thai font was implemented in v4.0, but frontend-dev agent verified it's NOT in codebase (still using GeistSans).

---

### 2. Timeline Extended (Line 177)
**v5.0 (WRONG):**
```markdown
**Estimated: 3 weeks (15 days) with 1 developer**
```

**v5.1 (CORRECTED):**
```markdown
**Revised Estimate: 4 weeks (20 days) with 1 developer** ‚è±Ô∏è
```

**Breakdown of Added Time:**
- Phase 1: +1 day (Thai font implementation, virtualization setup)
- Phase 4: +1 day (Dual-purpose panel complexity)
- Phase 6: +1 day (Story 1.5 QA buffer)
- Phase 7: +2 days (Comprehensive testing, accessibility audit)

**Target Launch:**
- v5.0: October 26, 2025
- v5.1: November 2, 2025 ‚úÖ

---

### 3. FilterState Interface Added
**v5.0 (MISSING):**
- Referenced FilterState but never defined it

**v5.1 (ADDED):**
```typescript
// lib/types.ts - To be added
export interface FilterState {
  gender?: 'all' | 'men' | 'women'
  occasion?: string[]  // ['work', 'casual', 'date', 'formal']
  priceRange?: { min: number; max: number }
  searchQuery?: string
}
```

**Why:** Technical reviewers need exact TypeScript definition to validate implementation.

---

### 4. Mobile UX Strategy Clarified
**v5.0 (VAGUE):**
```markdown
- ‚úÖ Mobile users can navigate all panels via tabs
```

**v5.1 (SPECIFIC):**
```markdown
**Mobile (<768px):** Single full-screen view with bottom tabs
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  Active Panel       ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  (Filters/Outfits/  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   Chat)             ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ [üîç] [üëï] [üí¨]     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Bottom Tab Navigation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Why:** Stakeholders and developers need clear understanding of mobile behavior.

---

### 5. Virtualization Library Decision Added
**v5.0 (MISSING):**
- Mentioned "react-window" but no formal decision point

**v5.1 (ADDED):**
```markdown
### Decision 3: Virtualization Library (Technical)
**Options:**
- Option A: react-window (recommended)
- Option B: react-virtualized
- Option C: Native CSS + Pagination
```

**Implementation Note:** Library needs to be added to package.json before development

**Why:** react-window is NOT in current dependencies, must be explicitly approved and added.

---

### 6. Story 1.5 Dependency Risk Documented
**v5.0 (MISSING):**
- Assumed Story 1.5 was ready
- No risk mitigation

**v5.1 (ADDED):**
```markdown
### Decision 4: Story 1.5 Dependency Acknowledgment (Important)
**Status:** Story 1.5 is "Ready for Review" but NOT marked "Done"

**Risk:**
- QA may find issues during Story 2.1 implementation
- 2-3 day buffer added to timeline for potential fixes

**Decision Required:**
- [ ] Confirm Story 1.5 QA completion before Phase 6 (Day 16)
```

**Why:** Story 1.5 is prerequisite, not yet QA-approved. Need stakeholder awareness.
