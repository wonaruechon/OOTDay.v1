## Testing Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Flows (Manual)
1. **Filter & Discover:**
   - Apply gender filter → See filtered outfits
   - Apply occasion filter → See matching outfits
   - Adjust price range → See price-filtered outfits
   - Search query → See search results

2. **Select & Purchase:**
   - Click outfit card → See detail view
   - Click "Buy Now" → Opens Central.co.th (correct gender)
   - Click similar outfit → Switches to that outfit
   - Click "Explore more outfits" → Returns to chat

3. **State Persistence:**
   - Apply filters → Copy URL → Open in new tab → Filters applied ✓
   - Select outfit → URL contains outfit ID ✓
   - Browser back → Returns to previous state ✓

### Priority 2: Responsive Testing
- Test on real devices (iPhone, Android, iPad)
- Verify touch interactions smooth
- Check Thai font renders on all devices

### Priority 3: Accessibility Audit
- Run axe-core DevTools
- Test with screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA)
- Verify keyboard navigation complete

---

## Known Considerations

1. **Occasion Filter:** Currently displays but requires `outfit.style` field from data (placeholder for Story 1.5 full integration)

2. **Images:** Using placeholder backgrounds (gray) - ready for real product images from Central CDN

3. **Caching:** In-memory cache (resets on page reload) - can upgrade to localStorage/sessionStorage if needed

4. **Mobile Bottom Tabs:** Currently shows placeholder filters - can be enhanced with full NavigationFilters component
