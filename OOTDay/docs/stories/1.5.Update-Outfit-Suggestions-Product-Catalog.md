# Story 1.5: Update Outfit Suggestions to Use Product Catalog - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user seeking fashion recommendations,
**I want** outfit suggestions to use real products from the Central Group catalog,
**so that** I can purchase the exact items shown in the recommended outfits.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Outfit recommendation logic in `lib/mock-data.ts`, Product catalog from CSV
- Technology: Next.js, TypeScript, outfit generation algorithm
- Follows pattern: Existing `mockOutfits` structure with real catalog products
- Touch points: Outfit data generation, chat AI response, outfit display components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Outfit suggestions use products from real product catalog (Product_Men.csv, Product_Woman.csv)
2. Outfits are gender-appropriate based on user query context
3. Outfit suggestions include 2-5 coordinated products per outfit

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing Outfit interface remains unchanged
5. Outfit generation logic replaces mock products with catalog products
6. AI chat responses continue to work with new outfit data

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Outfit product combinations are fashion-appropriate (e.g., tops + bottoms + shoes)
8. Price calculation reflects real product prices from catalog
9. At least 3-5 diverse outfit options available for common queries

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Create `lib/outfit-generator.ts` utility to generate outfits from product catalog
  - Implement basic outfit composition logic (categorize products by type, combine appropriately)
  - Update `getMockOutfitResponse()` in mock-data.ts to use catalog-based outfits
- **Existing Pattern Reference:**
  - Current `mockOutfits` structure in `lib/mock-data.ts` lines 102-143
  - Outfit interface: `{ id, title, description, totalPrice, items: Product[], imageUrl }`
- **Key Constraints:**
  - Products categorized by type (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories) for proper outfit composition
  - Gender-specific outfit generation (men's products for men's queries, women's for women's)
  - Outfit price range should be reasonable and varied (e.g., ฿2,000 - ฿10,000)

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `frontend/lib/mock-data.ts` - Contains `mockOutfits` and `getMockOutfitResponse()` to update
- `frontend/lib/types.ts` - Outfit and Product interfaces
- `frontend/lib/product-loader.ts` - CSV parser with product catalog (created in Story 1.1)
- `docs/Product_Men.csv` - Men's product catalog
- `docs/Product_Woman.csv` - Women's product catalog

**Outfit Interface (from types.ts):**
```typescript
interface Outfit {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  totalPrice: number
  items: Product[]
  imageUrl?: string
}
```

**Product Categorization Strategy:**
- Parse product name/description to identify type:
  - Tops: shirt, blouse, t-shirt, top, blazer, jacket
  - Bottoms: trousers, pants, jeans, shorts, skirt
  - Shoes: shoes, boots, sneakers, sandals
  - Accessories: bag, belt, watch, sunglasses
  - Dresses: dress (standalone outfit item for women)
- Use Sub-Category field from CSV if available

**Outfit Generation Algorithm (Basic):**
```typescript
function generateOutfit(products: Product[], gender?: string): Outfit {
  const categorized = categorizeProducts(products)

  // Example: Business outfit = top + bottom + shoes
  const top = randomPick(categorized.tops)
  const bottom = randomPick(categorized.bottoms)
  const shoes = randomPick(categorized.shoes)

  const items = [top, bottom, shoes].filter(Boolean)
  const totalPrice = items.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.price, 0)

  return {
    id: `outfit-${Date.now()}`,
    title: generateOutfitTitle(items),
    description: generateOutfitDescription(items),
    totalPrice,
    items,
    imageUrl: items[0]?.imageUrl // Use first item's image as outfit image
  }
}
```

**Integration with Chat Response:**
- Update `getMockOutfitResponse()` to generate fresh outfits from catalog
- Match query keywords (business, casual, formal) to outfit style
- Generate gender-appropriate outfits based on query context

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `frontend/lib/__tests__/outfit-generator.test.ts`
- Testing framework: Jest
- Test requirements:
  - Unit test product categorization function
  - Unit test `generateOutfit()` with various product sets
  - Unit test gender-specific outfit generation
  - Test outfit price calculation accuracy
  - Test outfit title/description generation
  - Integration test with real CSV data
  - Test edge cases (empty product list, single product, etc.)

## Risk and Compatibility

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Outfit combinations may not be fashion-appropriate; insufficient product variety in catalog
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement basic fashion rules (e.g., don't combine two tops)
  - Start with simple outfit templates (top+bottom+shoes)
  - Fallback to showing individual products if outfit generation fails
  - Can enhance with AI-powered matching in future iterations
- **Rollback:** Revert to original `mockOutfits`; simple import swap

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] Outfit interface unchanged (non-breaking)
- [x] Existing components work with generated outfits
- [x] No database changes (uses CSV data)
- [x] Performance impact: outfit generation happens on-demand (minimal)
